# Task 2 – Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)

Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using the service) based on historical data.

Key Steps:
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Train/test split
- Model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

Tools & Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

# Task 3 – Household Power Consumption Forecasting (Time Series)

Objective: Forecast future electricity usage based on historical power consumption data.

Key Steps:
- Data preprocessing and datetime handling
- Exploratory time series analysis
- Resampling and feature extraction
- Forecasting using Prophet model (by Facebook)
- Visualization of trends and seasonality

Tools & Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `prophet`, `seaborn`
